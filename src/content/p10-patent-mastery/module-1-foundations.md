## Day 2: What Can and Cannot Be Patented in India

### Learning Objectives
- Master Section 3 exclusions and circumvention strategies
- Understand software patentability in Indian context
- Navigate AI/ML patent claiming requirements
- Develop technical solution approaches for business methods

### The Section 3 Challenge: ₹500 Crore in Rejected Applications

Every year, Indian startups lose ₹500+ crores in rejected patent applications due to Section 3 exclusions. Understanding these exclusions and developing circumvention strategies is critical for success.

### Patentability Criteria: The Triple Test

#### 1. Novelty (Section 2(1)(j))
**Definition:** Invention must not be anticipated by prior art anywhere in the world

**Global Novelty Standard:**
- Prior publication anywhere destroys novelty
- Prior use that makes invention available to public
- Prior patent filing with same invention
- Grace period: None in India (file before any disclosure)

**Practical Assessment:**
```
Novelty Checklist:
□ Comprehensive prior art search completed
□ No identical invention found in any database
□ No public disclosure of invention before filing
□ No prior sale or offer for sale
□ Differences over closest prior art identified
```

#### 2. Inventive Step (Section 2(1)(ja))
**Test:** Would the invention be obvious to a person skilled in the art?

**Indian Approach (Similar to Graham v. John Deere):**
1. Determine scope and content of prior art
2. Identify differences between prior art and claims
3. Assess level of ordinary skill in the art
4. Evaluate obviousness of differences

**Obviousness Indicators:**
- **Obvious:** Simple combination of known elements
- **Non-Obvious:** Unexpected results, solves long-felt need, commercial success

#### 3. Industrial Application (Section 2(1)(ac))
**Requirement:** Invention must be capable of being made or used in industry

**Broad Definition:**
- Includes agriculture, fishery, and other economic activities
- Software applications qualify if they solve technical problems
- Business methods can qualify with technical implementation
