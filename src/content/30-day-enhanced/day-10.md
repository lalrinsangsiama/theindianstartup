# Day 10: MVP Planning - Define Your Minimum Viable Product

## 🌅 Morning Brief (3 min read)

Today marks the beginning of your product journey! You'll transform your validated idea into a concrete **MVP** plan. 

**What is an MVP?**
- **MVP = Minimum Viable Product** - the simplest version of your product that still solves the core problem
- **Why MVP matters:** Lets you test your idea with real users without spending months/lakhs building features they might not want
- **MVP ≠ Poor Quality:** It should work perfectly for its limited scope - think of it as a bicycle, not a broken car
- **Indian Context:** Indian users expect value even from free products, so your MVP must solve the core problem elegantly while remaining simple enough to build in 2-4 weeks

This is where ideas become reality - moving from "what if" to "here it is!"

**Today's Focus:** Design an MVP that users will love, not just tolerate.

**Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- Core features defined and prioritized
- User journey mapped completely
- Tech stack decided
- Development timeline created
- Resource allocation planned
- Success metrics established
