ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SETUP

[This would be a real Excel file with:
- Chart of accounts setup
- Journal entry templates
- Ledger account formats
- Trial balance template
- Monthly closing checklist
- Reconciliation templates
- Cash book formats
- Purchase and sales registers
- Expense tracking sheets
- Asset depreciation calculator

This is a placeholder - in production, this would be a comprehensive accounting setup with Indian accounting standards compliance and automated calculations.]
