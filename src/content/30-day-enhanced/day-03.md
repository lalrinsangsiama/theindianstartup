# Day 3: Customer Discovery & Validation Interviews

## üåÖ Morning Brief (3 min read)

Today is pivotal - you'll validate your assumptions by talking to real potential customers. **Customer discovery** means interviewing people who have the problem you're solving to understand if your solution idea actually makes sense. In India's diverse market, this requires cultural sensitivity, language awareness, and understanding of local contexts. Remember: You're not selling, you're learning.

**Today's Focus:** Listen more, talk less. Your assumptions will be challenged.

**Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- **5-10 customer interviews completed** (actual conversations with potential customers)
- **Pain points validated/invalidated** (confirm which problems are real vs imagined)
- **Customer personas refined** (detailed profiles of your ideal customers based on real data)
- **Solution direction confirmed/pivoted** (decide if your idea is right or needs major changes)

## üí° Expert Insights

### From Successful Founders

> **"My biggest mistake was asking 'Would you use an app that...' Instead, ask 'Tell me about the last time you faced...' The stories reveal truth."**
> - *Ankur Warikoo, Nearbuy Founder*

> **"Indian customers rarely say no directly. Watch for 'We'll think about it' or 'Send me details' - these often mean no. Dig deeper."**
> - *Upasana Taku, Razorpay COO*

> **"Don't interview in English if your product is for Bharat. You'll miss critical insights that only emerge in native languages."**
> - *Vidit Aatrey, Meesho Founder*

### Cultural Intelligence for Interviews

**Reading Between Lines:**
- "It's okay" = It's not great
- "We'll see" = Probably no
- "Cost is fine" = It's expensive
- "My family will decide" = Major decision
- "I'll ask my friend" = Seeking validation
- "Send details on WhatsApp" = Genuine interest

**Regional Differences:**

- South: Detail-oriented, comparison shoppers
- East: Value-conscious, community-driven
- West: Early adopters, brand conscious
- Northeast: Digital-forward, quality-focused

### Common Interview Mistakes

1. **Leading the witness** - "Don't you think X is a problem?"
2. **Pitching too early** - Save it for the end
3. **Ignoring emotions** - Note frustration levels
4. **Surface-level probing** - Go 3-4 layers deep
5. **Confirmation bias** - Seeking only validation
6. **Poor logistics** - Technical issues, delays
7. **Cultural insensitivity** - Assumptions about users
