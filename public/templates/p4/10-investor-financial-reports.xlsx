INVESTOR FINANCIAL REPORTS

[This would be a real Excel file with:
- Monthly investor reports
- Quarterly financial statements
- Annual report templates
- Cash burn analysis
- Revenue growth metrics
- Unit economics reporting
- Milestone achievement tracking
- Financial projections vs actuals
- Board presentation templates
- Due diligence data room

This is a placeholder - in production, this would be professional investor-grade financial reporting templates with automated charts, graphs, and comparative analysis.]
