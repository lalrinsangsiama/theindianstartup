# Day 5: Business Model Design & Revenue Strategy

## 🌅 Morning Brief (3 min read)

Today, you'll design how your startup makes money sustainably. A **business model** is your plan for creating, delivering, and capturing value - essentially how you turn your solution into a profitable business. A great product without a viable business model is just a hobby. In India's price-sensitive yet volume-rich market, your business model needs to balance profitability with accessibility. We'll explore **revenue streams** (different ways you earn money), **cost structures** (what you spend money on), and **unit economics** (profit per customer) that work in the Indian context.

**Today's Focus:** Transform your value proposition into a money-making machine.

**Time Commitment:** 3-4 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- **Business Model Canvas completed** (visual one-page overview of how your business works)
- **Revenue streams identified** (all the different ways your business will make money)
- **Unit economics calculated** (profit you make per customer after all costs)
- **Pricing strategy finalized** (what you'll charge and why customers will pay it)
- **Growth model designed** (how you'll scale from 10 to 10,000 customers)
- **Financial projections drafted** (realistic estimates of income and expenses for next 12 months)
