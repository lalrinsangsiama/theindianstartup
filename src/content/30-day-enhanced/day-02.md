#### Market Size Calculation - Understanding TAM, SAM, and SOM

**Why Calculate Market Size?**
- **For You:** Know if your idea can become a big business
- **For Investors:** Prove there's a large enough opportunity worth investing in
- **For Strategy:** Decide where to focus your limited resources

**The Market Size Triangle:**

**🌍 TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
- **What it is:** The total money spent on solving your problem globally
- **Formula:** Total Population × % Who Have Problem × Average Annual Spend
- **Think of it as:** "If I could magically serve everyone who has this problem worldwide, how big would that be?"

Example Calculation:
```
Food Delivery in India:
Urban Internet Users (300M) × 
Restaurant Order Online (40%) × 
Average Annual Spend (₹12,000) = 
TAM: ₹1,44,000 Crores ($18 Billion)
```

Your TAM Calculation:
_________________________________

**🎯 SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**
- **What it is:** The portion of TAM you can realistically reach with your business model
- **Why smaller than TAM:** Geographic limits, language barriers, price sensitivity, technology constraints
- **Think of it as:** "Of all the people with this problem, who could realistically become my customer?"

Filters to Apply:
- Geographic reach (Can you serve rural areas?)
- Language capabilities (English vs Hindi vs Regional)
- Price point match (Will your pricing work for this segment?)
- Technology requirements (Smartphone, internet speed needed?)

Your SAM: __________ (___% of TAM)

**🚀 SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
- **What it is:** Your realistic market share within SAM over 3-5 years
- **Why important:** This is what determines your actual revenue potential
- **Think of it as:** "Of the customers I can reach, how many will I actually win?"

Consider:
- Competition intensity (How many others are fighting for the same customers?)
- Marketing budget (How much can you spend to acquire customers?)
- Growth rate (How fast can you scale your operations?)
- Differentiation strength (Why would customers choose you over others?)

Your SOM: __________ (___% of SAM)

**💡 Pro Tip:** A startup capturing even 1% of a ₹1,000 crore market becomes a ₹10 crore revenue business!
