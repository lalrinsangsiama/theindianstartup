Government schemes typically receive 10-50x more applications than available funding. Your application goes through multiple evaluation stages:

#### Stage 1: Administrative Screening (60% rejection rate)
**Evaluators:** Junior officers and clerks  
**Time per application:** 5-10 minutes  
**Focus:** Documentation completeness and basic eligibility

**Common rejection reasons:**
- Missing mandatory documents (35%)
- Incomplete application forms (25%)
- Eligibility criteria not met (20%)
- Expired certificates/documents (15%)
- Poor document quality (5%)

#### Stage 2: Technical Evaluation (70% rejection rate of remaining)
**Evaluators:** Subject matter experts and senior officers  
**Time per application:** 30-45 minutes  
**Focus:** Project viability, innovation potential, and impact

**Evaluation criteria and weightage:**

### The Winning Application Formula

#### Structure 1: The IMPACT Framework

**I - Identify the Problem**
```
Problem Statement Template:
"[Target Group] faces [Specific Challenge] resulting in [Quantified Impact].
Current solutions fall short because [Gap Analysis].
This affects [Scale] and costs the economy [Financial Impact] annually."

Example:
"Indian farmers face post-harvest losses of 30-40% due to inadequate
cold storage, resulting in ₹2.3 lakh crore annual losses. Current
cold storage solutions are too expensive and energy-intensive for
smallholder farmers. This affects 50 million farming families and
costs the economy ₹92,000 crore annually."
```

**M - Map Your Solution**
```
Solution Template:
"Our [Innovation Type] leverages [Technology/Methodology] to [Core Value Proposition].
Unlike existing solutions, we [Differentiation Factor].
This results in [Quantified Benefits] for [Target Users]."

Example:
"Our solar-powered micro cold storage leverages IoT sensors and
phase-change materials to maintain 2-8°C for 72 hours without grid
electricity. Unlike existing solutions, we're 60% cheaper and 90%
more energy-efficient. This results in 80% reduction in post-harvest
losses for smallholder farmers."
```

**P - Present Implementation Plan**
```
Implementation Template:
"Phase 1 (Months 1-6): [Foundation Activities]
Phase 2 (Months 7-12): [Development/Testing Activities]  
Phase 3 (Months 13-18): [Market Entry/Scaling Activities]

Each phase includes [Deliverables], [Milestones], and [Success Metrics]."
```

"Total Addressable Market: ₹[X] crore ([Source])
Serviceable Available Market: ₹[Y] crore ([Target Segment])
Our Target Market Share: [Z]% within [Timeline]
Revenue Projection: ₹[Amount] by Year 3"
```

**C - Calculate Financial Requirements**
```
Financial Template:
"Total Project Cost: ₹[Amount]
Government Grant Requested: ₹[Amount] ([%] of total)
Promoter Contribution: ₹[Amount] ([%] of total)
Expected ROI: [%] by Year [X]
Breakeven Timeline: [Months] from launch"
```

**T - Track Expected Impact**
