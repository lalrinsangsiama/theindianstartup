BUDGETING & FORECASTING MODEL

[This would be a real Excel file with:
- Annual budget template
- Monthly budget breakdown
- Rolling forecasts (12-month)
- Scenario planning models
- Department-wise budgets
- Capital expenditure planning
- Working capital management
- Variance analysis reports
- Budget approval workflows
- Performance tracking

This is a placeholder - in production, this would be a sophisticated budgeting model with multiple scenarios, automated calculations, and management reporting features.]
