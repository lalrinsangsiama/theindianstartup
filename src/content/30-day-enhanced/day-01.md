#### The 5W1H Framework
Answer these questions about your problem:

**WHO** has this problem?
- Primary audience (age, location, income)
- Secondary audience
- Total addressable market in India

**WHAT** exactly is the problem?
- Current pain points
- Frequency of occurrence
- Severity (1-10 scale)

**WHEN** does this problem occur?
- Specific situations
- Time of day/year
- Life events

**WHERE** does this problem manifest?
- **Physical locations** (offices, homes, stores, transportation hubs)
- **Digital touchpoints** (websites, apps, social media - places where customers interact with businesses online)
- **Geographic constraints** (city vs rural, regional differences, state-specific issues)

**WHY** does this problem exist?
- **Root causes** (fundamental issues that create the problem - like lack of education, poor infrastructure, or outdated systems)
- **Market failures** (when the free market doesn't solve the problem efficiently - gaps that create business opportunities)
- **Behavioral patterns** (how people's habits, culture, or psychology contribute to the problem)

**HOW** are people currently solving it?
- **Existing alternatives** (what products/services already try to solve this problem)
- **Workarounds** (temporary or manual solutions people use when no good product exists)
- **Cost of current solutions** (how much people currently pay in money, time, or effort)

#### India-Specific Considerations
- **Language diversity:** Does your solution need multiple languages?
- **Price sensitivity:** What's the willingness to pay in your target segment?
- **Infrastructure:** Consider internet connectivity, smartphone penetration
- **Cultural factors:** Family decision-making, trust factors
- **Payment methods:** Cash vs digital preferences

### 2. Solution Crafting (30 mins)

## 🚀 ADVANCED MATERIALS: Expert-Level Strategic Frameworks

### 🎓 Advanced Problem Analysis: The Clayton Christensen Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**Beyond Surface Problems: Understanding Causal Mechanisms**

Most entrepreneurs solve symptoms, not root causes. Use this advanced framework to uncover the fundamental job your customers are "hiring" your product to do:

#### **The Progress-Making Framework**
```
Struggling Moment Analysis:
├── PUSH (Current situation dissatisfaction)
│   ├── Functional inadequacy (current solution doesn't work)
│   ├── Emotional dissatisfaction (current solution feels wrong)
│   └── Social pressure (current solution reflects poorly)
├── PULL (Attraction to new solution)
│   ├── Functional attraction (new solution works better)
│   ├── Emotional reward (new solution feels right)
│   └── Social reward (new solution enhances status)
├── ANXIETY (Concerns about switching)
│   ├── Learning curve costs
│   ├── Switching costs (time, money, effort)
│   └── Uncertainty about outcomes
└── HABIT (Inertia keeping them stuck)
    ├── Familiarity with current solution
    ├── Switching energy required
    └── Status quo bias
```

**Advanced Exercise: Job Story Mapping**
Instead of "As a user, I want X so that Y," use:
"When I am _____ (context), and _____ (barrier), I want to _____ (motivation), so I can _____ (expected outcome)."

Example:
- Basic: "As a startup founder, I want faster incorporation so that I can start business legally."
- Advanced: "When I am validating my startup idea with potential customers, and I need credibility to close enterprise deals, I want to complete legal incorporation within 48 hours, so I can convert pilot opportunities into paid contracts without losing momentum to bureaucracy."

### 🎯 Advanced Market Opportunity Analysis: The TAM-SAM-SOM+ Framework

    └── Black swan events

Year 5 Projection: ₹Y crores (CAGR: Z%)
```

#### **Advanced SAM Segmentation: The Kano Model Integration**
```
Must-Have Features (Basic Expectations):
- Features that, if missing, cause immediate rejection
- Table stakes for market entry

- Viral growth and retention drivers
- Examples: Gamification, AI personalization, community features
```

### 🔬 Advanced Innovation Assessment: The Disruption Prediction Matrix

**Clayton Christensen's Disruption Theory Applied to Indian Markets**

#### **Disruption Readiness Score**
Rate your startup (1-10) on each dimension:

```
Market Conditions:
├── Overserved customers (existing solutions too complex/expensive) [__/10]
├── Non-consumers (large population unable to access current solutions) [__/10]
├── Performance surplus (current solutions exceed most users' needs) [__/10]
└── Value network disruption potential (new measures of value) [__/10]

Solution Characteristics:
├── Simplicity (easier to use than incumbents) [__/10]
├── Accessibility (reaches previously excluded segments) [__/10]
├── Affordability (significantly lower cost structure) [__/10]
└── Convenience (fits better into customer workflows) [__/10]

Total Disruption Score: ___/80
```

**Scoring Guide:**
- 60-80: High disruption potential (pursue aggressively)
- 40-59: Moderate disruption potential (validate carefully)
- 20-39: Low disruption potential (consider sustaining innovation)
- 0-19: No disruption potential (compete on execution)

### 💡 Advanced Goal Setting: The OKR (Objectives & Key Results) System

**Google/Intel's Goal-Setting Framework for Startups**

#### **30-Day OKR Template**
```
OBJECTIVE 1: Validate Product-Market Fit Hypothesis
├── KR1: Interview 50 potential customers with 80%+ confirming problem severity ≥8/10
├── KR2: Achieve 15%+ signup rate from problem-solution landing page
└── KR3: Get 3+ customers willing to pay before product exists

OBJECTIVE 2: Establish Legal & Financial Foundation
├── KR1: Complete incorporation with 0 compliance issues
├── KR2: Open business bank account and process first ₹10,000 transaction
└── KR3: File GST registration with approved status

OBJECTIVE 3: Build Minimum Viable Team
├── KR1: Identify and interview 10 potential co-founders/early employees
├── KR2: Define equity structure with legal advisor approval
└── KR3: Secure 2 advisors with relevant domain expertise
```

### 🧠 Advanced Assumption Testing: The Hypothesis-Driven Development

**Scientific Method Applied to Startup Building**

#### **The Assumption Risk Matrix**
```
Risk Assessment Framework:
                   High Impact on Business
                   ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
    High Certainty │  Execute    │   Test Fast │
                   │             │             │
                   ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
     Low Certainty │  Research   │ Test First  │
                   │             │ (Highest    │
                   └─────────────┴─────────────┘
                   Low Impact on Business
```

**Test Design Template:**
```
Hypothesis: "Indian SME owners will pay ₹2,999/month for automated GST compliance because manual compliance costs them 20+ hours monthly."

Falsifiable Prediction: "75% of SME owners interviewed will express willingness to pay ₹2,999/month when shown a working demo."

Test Design:
├── Method: Smoke test landing page with pricing
├── Sample Size: 100 targeted visitors
├── Success Criteria: 15+ email signups with payment intent
├── Timeline: 7 days
├── Budget: ₹5,000 (ad spend)
└── Learning Goal: Price sensitivity validation

Results Interpretation:
├── Hypothesis Confirmed: Proceed to MVP development
├── Hypothesis Rejected: Test lower price points (₹999, ₹1,499)
└── Inconclusive: Increase sample size or refine messaging
```
