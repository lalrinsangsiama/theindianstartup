### Reference Numeral Systems

#### Systematic Numbering Strategy

**Reference Numeral Organization:**
```
Numbering System Principles:
□ Sequential numbering preferred (1, 2, 3...)
□ Consistent across all figures
□ Every element must be numbered
□ No element left without reference
□ Logical grouping by function/system
□ International compatibility maintained
□ Prosecution flexibility preserved
□ Amendment accommodation planned

Professional Numbering Approaches:
1. Sequential System: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
2. Grouped System: 100s, 200s, 300s by category
3. Hierarchical System: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...
4. Functional System: 10s for input, 20s for processing
```

**Reference Numeral Best Practices:**
```
Implementation Standards:
□ Use leading lines when necessary
□ Position numerals clearly outside elements
□ Avoid crowding or overlapping
□ Maintain consistent font and size
□ Place numerals for easy reading
□ Use consistent positioning logic
□ Consider international reading patterns
□ Plan for amendment flexibility

Quality Assurance:
□ Cross-check all figure references
□ Verify specification correspondence
□ Confirm claim language alignment
□ Check for numbering duplications
□ Validate sequential consistency
□ Ensure complete element coverage
□ Review international compatibility
□ Prepare prosecution support documentation
```
