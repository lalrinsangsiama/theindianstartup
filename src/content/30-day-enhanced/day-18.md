# Day 18: MVP Testing & User Feedback

## Morning Brief ‚òÄÔ∏è
*Read Time: 3 minutes*

Today your **MVP** faces its most important test - real users with real problems trying to find real solutions. This is the moment when all your assumptions meet reality, and you discover what users actually want versus what you think they want.

**User testing** isn't just about finding bugs; it's about validating **product-market fit** (whether your product solves a real problem people will pay for), understanding user behavior, and identifying the gap between your vision and user reality. Today's insights will guide every future product decision.

**What You'll Accomplish Today:**
- Conduct structured **user testing sessions** (organized interviews where people try your product while you observe)
- Gather **quantitative and qualitative feedback** (numerical data like completion rates + descriptive feedback like "this confuses me")
- Identify critical **usability issues** (problems that prevent people from using your product easily)
- Validate core **value propositions** (confirm whether your promised benefits actually matter to users)
- Plan **product iterations** based on data (decide what to fix/improve next based on evidence, not guesses)
- Build **user feedback systems** (ongoing ways to collect user opinions)

**Time Commitment:** 5-6 hours (including user sessions)
**XP Available:** 220 points + validation achievements
