CAP TABLE MODELING

[This would be a real Excel file with:
- Current cap table structure
- Multiple funding round scenarios
- Employee stock option pool modeling
- Dilution calculations
- Waterfall analysis for exits
- Vesting schedules tracking
- Conversion rights modeling
- Pro-forma calculations
- Investor return scenarios

This is a placeholder - in production, this would be an advanced Excel model with automated calculations for complex capital structure scenarios across multiple funding rounds.]
