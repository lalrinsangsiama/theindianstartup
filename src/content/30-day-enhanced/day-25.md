# Day 25: Product Roadmap & Future Planning

## Morning Brief ☀️
*Read Time: 3 minutes*

Today you're charting your product's future - transforming user feedback, market insights, and strategic vision into a **roadmap** that guides development for the next 6-18 months. A **product roadmap** is a strategic plan showing what features you'll build, when, and why - helping everyone understand product direction and priorities. This isn't just feature planning; it's strategic product thinking that balances user needs, business goals, and **technical feasibility** (what's actually possible to build with your resources).

**What You'll Master Today:**
- Strategic **product roadmap development** (creating a long-term plan for what to build when)
- **Feature prioritization frameworks** (systematic methods for deciding which features to build first)
- **User feedback integration systems** (processes for collecting and acting on customer input)
- **Competitive analysis and positioning** (understanding competitors and differentiating your product)
- **Technical debt management** planning (handling code/infrastructure improvements needed for stability)
- Long-term **product vision alignment** (ensuring all features support your bigger goals)

**Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours
**XP Available:** 200 points + strategic planning achievements

### Phase 2: Feature Prioritization & Roadmap (90 mins, 70 XP)

#### 2.1 User Feedback Analysis *(30 mins)*
**Systematic Feedback Integration:**

**Feedback Collection Sources:**
- User interviews and surveys
- Support ticket analysis
- App store reviews and ratings
- Social media mentions
- Sales team input
- Customer success insights

**Feedback Categorization:**
```
Bug Fixes (Critical): 
- [List critical issues blocking users]
- Timeline: Immediate (0-2 weeks)

Feature Requests (High Impact):
- [Features requested by multiple users]
- Timeline: Short-term (1-2 months)

Enhancement Ideas (Nice-to-Have):

For each feature, score 1-10:

Reach: How many users will this impact?
Impact: How much will this improve their experience?
Confidence: How sure are we this will work?
Effort: How much work will this require? (1=low effort)

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

Example:
Feature: User Dashboard Redesign
Reach: 8 (affects all users)
Impact: 7 (significantly improves UX)
Confidence: 9 (high certainty)
Effort: 6 (moderate development time)
RICE Score = (8 × 7 × 9) ÷ 6 = 84
