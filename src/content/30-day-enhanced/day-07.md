# Day 7: Legal Structure & Founder Agreements

## 🌅 Morning Brief (3 min read)

Today is crucial for your startup's future. You'll choose the **legal structure** (the type of business entity like Private Limited Company, LLP, etc.) that determines everything from funding possibilities to tax implications, and create **founder agreements** (legal contracts between co-founders that define roles, equity, and decision-making) that prevent future conflicts. In India, getting the structure right from day one can save lakhs in restructuring costs and prevent painful disputes later.

**Today's Focus:** Build a rock-solid legal foundation for growth and harmony.

**Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- **Legal structure decided with clear rationale** (chosen the right business type based on your goals)
- **Founder agreement drafted and signed** (legal contract protecting all founders)
- **Equity split finalized with vesting** (who owns what percentage, earned over time)
- **Advisory board planned** (experienced people who will guide your startup)
- **ESOP pool allocated** (Employee Stock Option Plan - shares reserved for future employees)
- **Compliance roadmap created** (legal requirements and deadlines mapped out)

## 💡 Expert Insights

### Legal Wisdom

> **"The best time to create a founder agreement is when everyone still likes each other. The worst time is when they don't."**
> - *Rajan Anandan, Sequoia India MD*

> **"Your legal structure is like your outfit for a marathon. Wrong choice, and you'll regret it at mile 20."**
> - *TV Mohandas Pai, Aarin Capital*

> **"Equal equity splits are lazy. Different contributions deserve different rewards. Have the hard conversation early."**
> - *Shailesh Lakhani, Sequoia Partner*

### Common Legal Mistakes

1. **50-50 equity split** - Deadlock guaranteed
2. **No vesting schedule** - Departed founder keeps all
3. **Ignoring IP assignment** - Future disputes
4. **Complex structures early** - Expensive to maintain
5. **No written agreements** - Legal nightmare
6. **DIY legal work** - Penny wise, pound foolish
7. **Ignoring compliance** - Penalties compound

### Indian Legal Nuances

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Written agreements feel "untrusting"
- Family businesses resist structure
- Handshake deals common but risky
- Hierarchy expectations in decisions
- Reluctance to discuss exit
- Emotional vs logical equity
- Avoiding difficult conversations

**Practical Solutions:**
- Frame as "protection for all"
- Use trusted CA/lawyer as mediator
- Start with MOU, formalize later
- Regular founder dinners
- Document everything via email
- Celebrate agreement signing
- Make it about the mission
