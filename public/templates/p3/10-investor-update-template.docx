INVESTOR UPDATE TEMPLATE

[This would be a real Word document with:
- Monthly/quarterly update format
- Key metrics dashboard
- Financial performance summary
- Milestone achievements
- Challenges and roadblocks
- Team updates and hiring
- Product development progress
- Customer feedback and testimonials
