## The Problem Every Indian Founder Faces

You have a great startup idea. You're motivated. You're ready to build something incredible.

But then reality hits:

- How do you register a company in India?
- What's the difference between Private Limited and LLP?
- How do you get DPIIT recognition?
- What about GST registration?
- How do you create a pitch deck that actually gets funding?
- Where do you even start?

We've seen thousands of brilliant founders get stuck in this maze of bureaucracy, spending months (and ₹50,000+) on consultants just to get the basics sorted.

**That ends today.**
