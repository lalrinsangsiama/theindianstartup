# Day 14: GST & Tax Registration

## Morning Brief ‚òÄÔ∏è
*Read Time: 3 minutes*

Today you're tackling one of the most critical compliance requirements for Indian businesses - **GST registration** and comprehensive tax planning.

**What is GST?**
- **GST = Goods and Services Tax** - India's unified tax system that replaced dozens of different taxes
- **Why it matters:** Almost all businesses in India must register for GST and charge it to customers
- **The benefit:** You can claim "input credit" (get refunds) for GST you pay on business expenses
- **Key point:** GST isn't your money - you collect it from customers and pay it to the government

This isn't just about following rules; it's about setting up systems that will save you thousands in taxes and protect you from penalties.

With the right approach, tax compliance becomes a competitive advantage - enabling you to claim input credits (reduce your tax burden), build customer trust (official GST invoices), and qualify for government schemes that can accelerate your growth.

**What You'll Master Today:**
- Complete GST registration process
- Understand tax implications for your business
- Set up compliance tracking systems
- Plan tax optimization strategies
- Configure automated filing systems
- Prepare for future tax obligations

**Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours (including government portal time)
