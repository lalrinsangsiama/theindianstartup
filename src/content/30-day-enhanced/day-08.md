### 4. MOA & AOA Preparation (45 mins)

#### Understanding MOA & AOA - Your Company's Foundation Documents

**What are MOA & AOA?**
Think of these as your company's "birth certificate" and "rule book":

**📜 Memorandum of Association (MOA)** 
- **What it is:** Your company's "constitution" that defines its relationship with the outside world
- **Why it's required:** Legally mandated document that tells the world what your company can and cannot do
- **What it's used for:** Banks, investors, customers, and government agencies check this to understand your business scope
- **Key point:** Once filed, changing the MOA requires special procedures and government approval

**📋 Articles of Association (AOA)**
- **What it is:** Your company's "internal rule book" that governs how the company operates internally
- **Why it's required:** Defines how decisions are made, how meetings are conducted, how shares are transferred
- **What it's used for:** Resolving internal disputes, board meetings, investor relations, employee stock options
- **Key point:** Easier to change than MOA, but still requires proper board resolutions

#### Memorandum of Association (MOA) - Key Sections to Customize:

**Object Clause - Main Objects:**
```
1. To develop, design, create, market and deal in 
   computer software, mobile applications, and 
   technology solutions including but not limited 
   to [your specific area]

2. To provide consultancy, advisory, and technical 
   services in the field of [your domain]

3. To conduct research and development in emerging 
   technologies including artificial intelligence, 
   machine learning, blockchain, and related areas

[Add 2-3 specific to your business]
```

**Object Clause - Ancillary Objects:**
```
Standard ones cover:
- Borrowing powers
- Investment powers  
- Property acquisition
- Employee benefits
- IPR ownership
- General business powers

Usually no customization needed
```

**Liability Clause:**
Standard for Pvt Ltd - limited by shares

**Capital Clause:**
Must match SPICe+ entries exactly

**Subscription Page:**
Each subscriber signs for their shares

#### Articles of Association (AOA) - Your Company's Operating Manual

**What is Table F?**
- **Table F** is the standard template provided by the government for AOA
- **Why it works:** Contains all basic rules most startups need (meeting procedures, voting rights, share transfers)
- **When to customize:** Only when you have specific needs (multiple founder classes, investor protections, etc.)

**For Most Startups:** Table F is perfectly fine and saves time and legal costs

**Common Customizations (Advanced - Optional):**
```
Board Meetings:
- Minimum 4 per year
- 7 days notice
- Video conferencing allowed

Share Transfer:
- Board approval required
- First refusal to existing
- Transfer restrictions

Borrowing Powers:
- Limit without member approval
- Usually 10x paid-up capital

Director Appointments:
- Board can appoint additional
- Retirement by rotation
```
