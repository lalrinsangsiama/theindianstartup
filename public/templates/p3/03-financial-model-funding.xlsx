FINANCIAL MODEL FOR FUNDING

[This would be a real Excel file with:
- 5-year P&L projections
- Cash flow statements
- Balance sheet projections
- Revenue assumptions and drivers
- Cost structure breakdown
- Funding requirements calculation
- Scenario planning (best/worst/base case)
- Unit economics modeling
- Investor return calculations
- Sensitivity analysis

This is a placeholder - in production, this would be an advanced Excel model with formulas, charts, and investor-grade financial projections.]
